## a contemplation on what is possbile in typescript

> navigate around, contemplate, comment in/ comment out, what you want\
> note the export = {} hack on commonjs\
> if you are a noob, use chrome!\
> make sure tss is installed -g, then type `tsc -watch script.ts` to activate watcher on script.ts\ 
>you could also `npm run compileTS`, a litte bit easiger\
> run project with `npm run start`, but care, lite-server wants to open chrome\
> reconfigure this to your browser if needed, RTFM lite-server config
